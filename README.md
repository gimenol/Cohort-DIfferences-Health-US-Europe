# SHARE-HRS-ELSA

This repository will contain all the code that I use for my first chapter of my PhD, which will involve using three sister ageing cohorts to explore intergenerational differences in the timing of chronic disease and disability onset.

The datasets used are as follows: 

The Health and Retirement Survey, from the US. More information about [HRS](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/).

The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, from England. More information about [ELSA](https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/).

The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, for continental Europe. More information about [SHARE](http://www.share-project.org/home0.html).

This study uses already harmonised data from these surveys, which can be accessed through the [Gateway to Global Ageing Data](https://g2aging.org/).
